# EasyFlightControls
A simple approach to tackling flight controls for a mobile device

This project was made in unity version 2018.4.7f1
The main .cs file you need if you want to get things started
quickly is called FlightBehaviour.cs

The code was built for mobile devices, but can be quickly
altered to take horizontal and vertical input by other
means than a touch screen. More info commented in the .cs file.
Thanks for having a look at my little project :)
